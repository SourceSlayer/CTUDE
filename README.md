#CTUDE
Welcome to CTUDE.
This is a recreation of the Counter-Terrorism Unit's Desktop enviornment software.
It should look similar to that of CTU's desktop in 24 from seasons 1-6.


##Why?
For educational reasons mostly. Those creating their first QML/C++ applications right now may want to see some examples.

The code is messy right now, and admittidly, there are some files that shouldn't be there anymore and a few areas where implementation could be improved.
The C++ code is mainly nonexistent so far, save for the main file and header file created by default by Qt Creator.

##Will it work?
At the moment, functionality is lacking, a Window System has not really been added. Neither has a legitimate login.

So far, I have considered the following
- X11
-Wayland
Any opinions on which one would be appreciated. I have no experience with Window Mnager APIs, so this may be a bit of an uphill battle.
